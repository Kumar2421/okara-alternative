/**
 * Only providers with a real driver wired here can actually answer a chat
 * message. Providers listed in lib/mock-providers.ts but missing from this map
 * (xAI, OpenRouter) can still be "connected" in the UI/DB, but /api/chat
 * returns a clear "not wired yet" error for them instead of silently failing
 * or pretending to answer.
 *
 * groq/mistral are also the two PLATFORM_PROVIDER_KEYS (see
 * lib/llm/platformKeys.ts) — every agent/document route's platform-key
 * fallback depends on these actually being wired, not just "connectable".
 *
 * lmstudio/ollama/custom all reuse the OpenAI driver — they're all
 * OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` servers, just with a different
 * baseUrl and (usually) no real API key. One driver, three registry entries.
