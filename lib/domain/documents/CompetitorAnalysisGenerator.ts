Write a Competitor Analysis brief with exactly these section headers, in
this order. Write your actual answer under each header as plain Markdown —
never copy instruction text into your answer, never use angle brackets.

## Competitive Landscape
Write a Markdown table with columns "Competitor", "What they do" (one
sentence, from their crawled title/description only), and "Notable
difference vs ${req.projectName}" (one sentence, factual, no disparagement).
One row per competitor listed above. If a competitor's crawl failed, write
"Couldn't determine" in the relevant cells instead of guessing.

## Differentiation
Write 2-4 bullet points on how ${req.projectName} is positioned differently
from the competitors above, grounded only in the crawled data — not invented
feature comparisons.

## Gaps & Opportunities
Write 2-4 bullet points on possible content/positioning angles suggested by
comparing our page to the competitors' — e.g. a topic none of them cover in
their title/description, or a customer type they don't seem to target. If
the data is too thin to responsibly suggest anything, write exactly:
Not enough data yet — add more competitors or wait for their pages to be crawled again.`;
