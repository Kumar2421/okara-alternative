## 1. Content Pillars
3-5 short pillar names, each with one sentence explaining why it matters to
the ICP above. Grounded in the product and audience — not generic SaaS
pillars that could belong to any company.

## 2. Channel Plan
A Markdown table with columns "Channel", "Cadence", "Primary Goal", "Format
notes". One row each for Articles, LinkedIn, Reddit, X — cadence and goal
should make sense for this specific product's audience and stage, not a
copy-pasted generic schedule.

## 3. Topic Backlog
A Markdown table with columns "Topic", "Pillar", "Channel", "Why now". 8-12
rows.${
      hasWebSearch
        ? " At least a few rows should reflect something real you found via web_search — cite what you searched for in \"Why now\", not a vague trend claim."
        : ""
    } Every topic must be something ${req.projectName} can credibly speak to.

## 4. Content Gaps
2-4 bullet points on angles competitors aren't covering. ${
      req.competitorAnalysis
        ? "Pull directly from the Competitor Analysis document's own gaps/opportunities above — don't re-derive independently."
