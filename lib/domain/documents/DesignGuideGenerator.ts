for an AI marketing system. Every field you're given below was extracted

provided. Where a signal is missing, say so plainly (write exactly "Not

Write a Design Guide brief titled "${req.projectName} — Design Guide", with
exactly these section headers in this order. Write your actual answer under
each header as plain Markdown — never copy instruction text into your
answer, never use angle brackets in your output.

## 1. Brand Colors
A Markdown table with columns "Role", "Value", "Source". Include a "Theme
color" row using the real value above (or "Not stated on the page"). Don't
add rows for colors you weren't given.

## 2. Typography
State the font(s) found, labeled clearly. If none were found, write exactly:
Not stated on the page — no Google Fonts embed was found in the crawled HTML; the site may use system fonts or self-hosted fonts a static crawl can't detect.

## 3. Logo & Imagery
List the logo, favicon, and social image URLs given above, each labeled
(write "Not stated on the page" for any that are missing). Then, only if at
least one real color or image signal exists above, write one short paragraph
describing the likely visual style grounded only in what was actually found.
If none of theme color, fonts, logo, or social image were found, write
exactly instead: Not enough visual data on this page to describe a style —
this crawl found no theme-color tag, Google Fonts embed, or labeled logo image.

## 4. Voice-Visual Pairing
${
  req.marketingStrategy
    ? "One short paragraph connecting the brand voice/positioning above to how visual content (social posts, UGC video, imagery) should feel — grounded in the Marketing Strategy document, not invented."
    : 'No Marketing Strategy document exists yet for this project — write exactly: "Generate a Marketing Strategy document first for voice-visual pairing grounded in real positioning."'
}`;
