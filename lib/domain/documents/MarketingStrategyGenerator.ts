brief for an AI marketing system. Every downstream content agent (Articles,
LinkedIn, Reddit, X) will read this as ground truth for positioning and
audience — accuracy and defensibility matter more than sounding impressive.

Base your answer on the crawled page content, metadata, and Product
Information provided below. Where the page gives real signal (target
audience language, pricing model, competitor mentions), use it. Where it
doesn't, write reasonable, clearly-labeled inferences rather than confident
invented specifics — never state a percentage, dollar figure, or customer
count you weren't given.`;

Write a Marketing Strategy brief titled "${req.projectName} — Marketing Strategy Document",
with exactly these section headers in this order. Write your actual answer
under each header as plain Markdown — never copy instruction text into your
answer, never use angle brackets in your output.

## 1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
Write a **Primary:** paragraph describing the single most likely customer
segment, grounded in the page. Then a **Secondary:** paragraph for a
plausible second segment, if the page supports one — omit it if not.
Then a "Psychographic signals:" bulleted list of 3-5 short, concrete traits
(where they hang out, what tools they already use, what frustrates them) —
each bullet grounded in something on the page or a reasonable inference from it.

## 2. Positioning Statement
Write one paragraph in the classic "For [audience], [product] is the
[category] that [key benefit] — unlike [alternative], it [differentiator]."
shape, using ${req.projectName} and real details from the page.

## 3. Messaging Framework
Write a Markdown table with columns "Layer" and "Copy". Include these rows,
in order: Hero headline, Sub-headline, then 2-3 rows labeled "Value prop 1",
"Value prop 2", etc. Each Copy cell should be short, punchy marketing copy
consistent with the positioning statement above.`;
