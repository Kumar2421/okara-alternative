 * going past this free baseline is what the paid plan is for, via the
 * existing manual "Search Leads" flow in the Leads panel, which still
 * charges credits exactly as it does today. Self-host never calls this —
 * callers gate on FEATURES.PLATFORM_MODE before reaching it.

 * Targets the user's confirmed LEAD PROFILE (roles, company types, sizes,
 * locations, the problem solved, exclusions), rotating one combination per day
 * so repeated runs reach different people. Until the user confirms a profile
